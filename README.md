## Backstory
I am a huge coffee lover, but I find myself stop trying new coffee shops once I know a good one in the city. Also, I seldom meet people who are crazy about coffee as I do. So here comes CoffeeS, my problem solver.  :coffee:


## Features
- Questionary upon registering that collects data from users. :notebook:
